                "Just a short letter to say I can’t thank you enough for the results of my surgery. I am absolutely
                amazed with what you have been able to do. My breasts are perfect, exactly what I’d pick out of a
                magazine and unbelievable that you have been able to achieve this with what you had to work with,
                given that Transform had left them in a relative state following removal of ruptured PIPs.
                Furthermore I felt completely at ease, you were very kind and professional, as were all the staff at
                the hospital . Once again, thank you!” – Nicola 2014

                "Kind, friendly staff from the minute we walked in, felt very safe in their hands as nurses were
                always on hand and checking on me.”

                Brilliant care from all the staff!! Thank you so much."

                "Extremely helpful and friendly staff .They were very efficient & professional. Completely stress
                free experience, I couldn’t recommend this hospital highly enough."

                possible."

                "Professional care, first rate, this is the second time I have been at Springfield Hospital for a
                total hip replacement. I can’t praise all the staff on the high standards they keep up.""Upon
                arriving I have received nothing but kindness. Staff have been professional but with a smile at all
                times. Doctor’s have been very personable with good and kind manners."

                    my questions. Nothing was too much trouble. The hospital was spotlessly clean and attention to
                    detail was superb, I could not have asked for more. I have already recommended this hospital to
                    friends and family."

                    thanks go to Debbie and Cathy in day care, very efficient and kind, and 'Mim' (?) in theatre, felt
                    reassured by your kind presence. Thanks too to Dr Stoner for making sure I knew nothing about the
                    procedure! Definitely will recommend Springfield."

                anybody is as bad as me be assured you will be looked after so well. When it was my time to go to
                Theatre my angel appeared the nurse she held my hand so tight and spoke to me so kind and was there
                when i awoke in the recovery room i cant thank her enough and she will always be in my thoughts. God

                they are so kind and caring........"

                "From my first appointment right through to surgery the treatment I received was excellent.The
                nursing staff were helpful and friendly and very attentive. Pain control was excellent. I had my own
                room which made my stay much more comfortable.
