        <p style="text-align: justify; color: aliceblue;  ;">This college was started in October 1981 to fulfil the needs of the people of this region. Till then the youth of the southern districts had to go to Madurai and places farther away to pursue their engineering studies. Thus, with the starting of this college, one of the long felt expectations of the people of this area came to be fulfilled. This institution is ideally located in an extent of about 55 acres. It is about 1 km from Tirunelveli new bus stand. The college campus lies on the Tirunelveli - Trivandrum national highway.</p><br>
